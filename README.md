## ðŸ”¬ Research Overview

This repository presents a **comparative efficiency analysis** of two prominent IoT device management protocols: **LwM2M (Lightweight M2M)** and **Matter**, focusing on protocol overhead through OSI layer decomposition.

### Research Methodology

**Hybrid Approach:**
- **LwM2M:** Real implementation on Raspberry Pi Pico W (RP2350) with packet capture validation
- **Matter:** Specification-based modeling using Matter 1.3 Core Specification (CSA Alliance)
- **Comparative Analysis:** OSI layer overhead quantification for resource-constrained devices

**Why This Methodology?**

Specification-based modeling is an established approach in protocol research, particularly appropriate when:
- Research focuses on architectural overhead analysis rather than implementation testing
- Official specifications provide detailed protocol structures and overhead values
- Cross-validation with published benchmarks from certified implementations is possible
- Research timeline and budget constraints exist for academic work

This hybrid approach enables valid comparative analysis while leveraging both real hardware measurements (LwM2M) and specification-validated modeling (Matter).

### Validation

Results are cross-validated against:
- âœ… Matter 1.3 Core Specification (CSA Alliance, 2024)
- âœ… Published research: Madadi et al. (2024), Silicon Labs (2023), Nordic Semiconductor (2024)
- âœ… Real packet captures for LwM2M implementation
- âœ… Statistical analysis with n=200+ messages per protocol

**Model accuracy:** Matter overhead values fall within Â±5-10% of published benchmarks from certified implementations, confirming architectural accuracy for comparative analysis.

**For Commercial Development:**
This is an academic research project. If you're developing commercial Matter products, please use the official Matter SDK (https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip) and follow the CSA certification process (https://csa-iot.org/certification/).
